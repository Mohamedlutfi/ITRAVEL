          <p>
            Hey! I'm <strong>Yazan</strong>, a 21-year-old traveler from <strong>Sweden</strong>.
            I'm currently studying <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, but my biggest passion
            is exploring the world and discovering everything about <strong>nature</strong> and
            <strong>history</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been lucky enough to visit <strong>15 countries</strong> so far — each one teaching
            me something new about life, culture, and adventure. My goal is to
            <strong>visit every country in the world</strong>, and I truly believe that travel
            doesn’t have to be expensive — it’s all about curiosity and experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together with my best friend <strong>Mohamed</strong>, we document our travels,
            share our favorite photos, and hope to inspire others to explore the beauty of our planet.

          <p>
            Hi! I'm <strong>Mohamed</strong>, 20 years old and also from <strong>Sweden</strong>.
            I study <strong>Software Engineering</strong> at the same university as Yazan,
            where our friendship and travel journey began.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve visited <strong>10 countries</strong> so far, and what I love most is exploring
            the <strong>history</strong> and <strong>natural beauty</strong> of each place —
            from mountains and forests to ancient cities full of stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traveling with Yazan makes every adventure more exciting. Our dream is to
            <strong>travel to every country</strong> and share the journey with people who love
            discovery and culture as much as we do.
